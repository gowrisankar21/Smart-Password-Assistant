Is your home network secure...?

Theme:- **Sustainable development for better tomorrow

⋅⋅Security and privacy are the two basic needs of every internet user. Each one have their own network, where they are comfort. What if someone intrude to this. As of an old saying "Prevention is better than cure", all should maintain some basic practice to be secure. We also know that, if anything is executable in a system, then it is hackable. The root of the hacking is when the attacker get into our network. How can we prevent this? 
⋅⋅Smart-Password-Assistant will make you secure. Every security experts instructs us to change our credentials subsequently. But well knowingly we ignore it because of the boring steps we have to go through during password change. But the Smart-Password-Assistant can easily make it possible for your wireless network. We just need to instruct the machine to update our password and to ensure a secondary security, system encrypts the password and only share the key with the user. The user only having the decrypting android application can access the network. 
⋅⋅Hey now you are safe. You have the assistant with you. Go ahead....!
